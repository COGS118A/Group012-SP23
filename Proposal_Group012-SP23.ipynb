A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better.

    "In this project, our goal is to build a model that can predict the stage of Alzheimer’s disease within an individual based upon MRI scan images. In the specific dataset that we are working with, there are 4 levels of severity that are presented: none, very mild, mild, and moderate. This dataset also provides us with both the original and augmented images of the scans. The MRI scans are separated into 4 sets based upon severity, and we will use a set of these images and their respective classifications to train our model, and then test our model with the images we set aside to use as our testing data. We also may use methods like cross-validation to increase accuracy, but due to the large size of our data set, we may only use a subset of the data in our model development process. Our objective is to develop an algorithm that can gauge the severity of Alzheimer’s disease within a patient using their MRI scan, and we will use our chosen database to train and test our model, and test performance and predictive accuracy through methods such as confusion matrices, AUC-ROC and others that we find fit."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss, loss of cognitive abilities and change in behavior. Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI’s) is an imaging technique utilized to visualize internal parts of the brain. MRI’s detect the abnormalities in the brain that are associated with diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. With our study patients experiencing Alzheimer’s disease, their cortical thickness diminishes as well as the hippocampus breaking down which can deteriorate rapidly with age. Typically, we see this degeneration process in ages 60 and above, however, there are cases of Alzheimer’s starting in a person’s 30’s. With our dataset on Kaggle</a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference_1), we aim to explore how image segmentation and advanced processing techniques can detect early onset symptoms, identify significant discrepancies through brain image processing, and monitor the progression of the disease. With our model, images of MRI scans will be trained and tested to help improve accuracy and prevent overfitting of our different stages of Alzheimer’s. We aim to determine different levels of Alzheimer's disease through image classification of MRI scans. Other models </a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#reference_2) extract relevant features from the MRI scans with dementia patients and utilized metrics, such as, ROC-AUC to differentiate between healthy or not. Deep learning models contribute to the idea of medical analysis with image processing.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we will be tackling in the duration of this project is the determination and diagnosis of levels of Alzheimer’s disease within patients by using image classification of their MRI scans. Our objective is to develop a model that will be able to identify whether a given individual has none, very mild, mild or moderate levels of dementia based upon their MRI scan. We will use image data from our chosen database to train and test our model. Some of the metrics and techniques we may use in our model development are feature extraction and feature engineering, KNN and decision tree algorithms to assist us with classification tasks, and cross-validation, ROC-AUC and correlation matrices to analyze the accuracy and predictive validity of our model. In the feature engineering process, we may opt for methods such as PCA to create feature vectors which we could then proceed to use other techniques on to propel our classification algorithm. In this project, we are dealing explicitly with classifying images based on four specific classifications: (1) none, (2) very mild, (3) mild, and (4) moderate. We will not be dealing with any subjectivity in diagnosis or any gray area that lies outside of these four specific classifications that have been provided to us by our dataset. The dataset we have chosen is extremely large, having over forty-thousand images, and although we may not use all the data for this project in the sake of efficiency, time and complexity, we will still have a very large dataset to work with which inherently has benefits in aspects such as reproducibility. By having our project focus on classifying images into four specific categories, we ensure the quantifiable nature of our problem, while also establishing the measurability by utilizing various techniques and metrics to approach our problem that has been taught to us throughout the quarter."

    "In our dataset, we may have ethical concerns of patient confidentiality because we are analyzing patients with Alzheimer. These datasets can be collected from Kaggle, however, the images included are mainly MRI and will not reveal any personal information on the patients. All data will minimize any potentially harmful consequences and only be utilized to help predict results/analysis. While we are aware that we are dealing with sensitive data in this project, such as medical images and scans, we are solely using data that is readily available to the public on a site like Kaggle, and opted to not use data from specific medical/neurological research sites that warranted request applications in order to access some of their datasets. These measures taken by us will prevent a multitude of ethical violations, along with the fact that there is no patient identification information provided along with the dataset and the images. For the duration of this project, we will continue to be mindful of ethics and privacy with each step we take. \n"
